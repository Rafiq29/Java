You've been given an integer nested array with random values
like that:
int[][] origin = {{1,6,3}, {}, {5,4}, {7,8,2,9}, {}};

1. print it in a sorted way on one line
   without nested structures
2. find the minimum element
3. find the maximum element
4. calculate the number of elements
5. calculate the average of all elements
6. calculate the total amount of all elements
